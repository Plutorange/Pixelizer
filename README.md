Pixelizer.

Pixelate your image.
1. After starting the code, type the file name you want to pixelate (if it is in the same folder) or the full path of the file.
2. Then enter the strength of pixelation. The bigger the number, the bigger the pixels will be.
3. Set the image size you want relative to 1/strength x original. The bigger the number, the bigger the image size will be.
4. Finally, print the full name of the new file (with extension).

At the end, you will receive the pixelated image in the same folder as the code file.

You don't have to memorize all the steps. Messages in the code will guide you through the entire process.

I've also added a few test images in case you want to see how it works.



I am working on improving the color palette.
